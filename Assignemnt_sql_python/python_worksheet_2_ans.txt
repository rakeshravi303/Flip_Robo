Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.
Ans:-
A List is a sequence of elements in a specific order. A list is represented by "[]" and are mutable.

A Tuple is basically an immutable list, represented by "()".

A Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. Sets are written with curly brackets "{}".

A Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’
with space in python.
Ans:-
Strings are mutuable in python. 
Code for replacing + with space :-
	str="I+Love+Python"
	str.replace("+", " ")
										 
13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting
the datatype of a variable in python.
Ans:-
The ord() function in Python accepts a string of length 1 as an argument and returns the unicode code point representation of the passed argument. For example ord('B') returns 66 which is a unicode code point value of character 'B'.
str="I+Love+Python"
type(str)

Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.

14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥
2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0. Where a, b and c are to
be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0.

15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input
the value of ‘n’.
