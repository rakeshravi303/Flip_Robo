Q12 to Q15 are subjective answer type questions, Answer them briefly.
12. Explain R2 and adjusted R2 metrics?
Ans:-
R-squared defines the degree to which the variance in the dependent variable (or target) can be explained by the independent variable (features).
Similar to R-squared, the Adjusted R-squared measures the variation in the dependent variable (or target), explained by only the features which are helpful in making predictions. Unlike R-squared, the Adjusted R-squared would penalize you for adding features which are not useful for predicting the target.


13. Explain the cost function of linear regression?
Ans:-
Cost functions are used to estimate how badly models are performing. A cost function is a measure of how wrong the model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between X and y. This is typically expressed as a difference or distance between the predicted value and the actual value. The cost function (you may also see this referred to as loss or error.) can be estimated by iteratively running the model to compare estimated predictions against “ground truth” — the known values of y.
The MSE in the case of Linear Regression is the cost function. It is simply the mean of the squared differences between predicted y and actual y (i.e. the residuals).


14. Differentiate SSE, SSR and SST.
Ans:-
SST:- The sum of squares total, is the squared differences between the observed dependent variable and its mean.
SSR:- The sum of squares due to regression is the sum of the differences between the predicted value and the mean of the dependent variable. 
SSE:- The sum of squares error is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value.


15. What are the various evaluation metrics for linear regression?
Ans:-
	1. Mean Squared Error(MSE) 
	2. Root-Mean-Squared-Error(RMSE) 
	3. Mean-Absolute-Error(MAE).
	4. R-squared or Coefficient of Determination.
	5. Adjusted R-squared
