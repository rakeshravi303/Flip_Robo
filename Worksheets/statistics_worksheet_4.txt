Q10and Q15 are subjective answer type questions, Answer them in your own words briefly.

10. What do you understand by the term Normal Distribution?
Ans:- 
The normal distribution is a probability function that describes how the values of a variable are distributed. It is a symmetric distribution where most of the observations cluster around the central peak and the probabilities for values further away from the mean taper off equally in both directions. Extreme values in both tails of the distribution are similarly unlikely.

11. How do you handle missing data? What imputation techniques do you recommend?
Ans:-
1. Dropping rows with null values
2. Dropping features with high nullity
3. Mean, median or mode substitution

12. What is A/B testing
Ans:-
A/B testing refers to the experiments where two or more variations of the same webpage are compared against each other by displaying them to real-time visitors to determine which one performs better for a given goal. A/B testing is not limited by web pages only, you can A/B test your emails, popups, sign up forms, apps and more. Nowadays, most MarTech software comes with an A/B testing function built-in.

13. Is mean imputation of missing data acceptable practice?
Ans:-
Yes, we can use mean imputation to handle missing values, but if we are using mean imputation where data is missing in a big amount it may distort the relation of the most frequent label.

14. What is linear regression in statistics?
Ans:-
Linear regression is used to study the linear relationship between a dependent variable Y (eg: blood pressure) and one or more independent variables X (eg: age, weight, sex). Performing a linear regression makes sense only if the relationship is linear. Other methods must be used to study nonlinear relationships.

15. What are the various branches of statistics?
Ans:-
The two main branches of statistics are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.
