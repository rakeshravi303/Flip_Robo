11. What is data-warehouse?
Ans:- A data warehouse is a large collection of business data used to help an organization make decisions. A Data warehouse is typically used to connect and analyze business data from heterogeneous sources. The data warehouse is the core of the BI system which is built for data analysis and reporting.

12. What is the difference between OLTP VS OLAP?
A Data warehouse is typically used to connect and analyze business data from heterogeneous sources. The data warehouse is the core of the BI system which is built for data analysis and reporting.

13. What are the various characteristics of data-warehouse?
Ans:-
	a)Integrated: The way data is extracted and transformed is uniform, regardless of the original source.
	b)Time-variant: Data is organized via time-periods (weekly, monthly, annually, etc.).
	c)Non-volatile: A data warehouse is not updated in real-time. It is periodically updated via the uploading of data, protecting it from the influence of momentary change.

14. What is Star-Schema??
Ans:- 
In data warehousing and business intelligence (BI), a star schema is the simplest form of a dimensional model, in which data is organized into facts and dimensions. It is said to be star as its physical model resembles to the star shape having a fact table at its center and the dimension tables at its peripheral representing the starâ€™s points.

15. What do you mean by SETL?
Ans:-
SETL (SET Language) is a very high-level programming language based on the mathematical theory of sets. SETL provides two basic aggregate data types: unordered sets, and sequences (the latter also called tuples). The elements of sets and tuples can be of any arbitrary type, including sets and tuples themselves. Maps are provided as sets of pairs (i.e., tuples of length 2) and can have arbitrary domain and range types. Primitive operations in SETL include set membership, union, intersection, and power set construction, among others.
